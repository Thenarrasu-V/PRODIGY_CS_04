This code represents one of my internship tasks at Prodigy InfoTech. It is a basic keylogger program written in Python using the pynput library. The program prompts the user for a specified duration during which keystrokes will be captured. The captured keystrokes are then saved to a file named keylogger_log.txt for later review.

Prior to running this code, ensure that the pynput library is installed. Additionally, executing this code may require superuser or administrator privileges. In my testing environment on a Kali Linux virtual machine, I ran the program as a superuser.
